# TwiBot-22 Dataset

## Dataset Overview

The TwiBot-22 dataset is an updated Twitter bot detection dataset released in 2022. It expands upon previous TwiBot datasets by covering multiple communities and topics, providing a more diverse and realistic set of social network accounts. TwiBot-22 is particularly useful for evaluating domain-adaptive and large-scale bot detection models.

Key characteristics of the dataset:

- **Account Types**: Includes both human users and bot accounts.
- **Data Contents**: Rich information on user profiles, tweet histories, social relationships, and community structures.
- **Scale**: Multi-community dataset, suitable for large-scale and cross-domain bot detection experiments.
- **Research Value**: Useful for studies on social bot detection, graph-based learning, community analysis, and domain adaptation.
