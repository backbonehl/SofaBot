# Cresci-15 Dataset

## Dataset Overview

The Cresci-15 dataset is a publicly available dataset for **social bot detection** on Twitter, collected and curated by Cresci et al. in 2015. It includes multiple types of accounts, such as genuine human users and various categories of bot accounts. This dataset is widely used in social network analysis, machine learning, and graph-based research for evaluating social bot detection algorithms.

Key characteristics of the dataset:

- **Account Types**: Includes both human users and bot accounts.
- **Data Contents**: Each account contains user profile attributes, historical tweets, follower-following relationships, and other social network information.
- **Scale**: Covers multiple account groups, suitable for large-scale social network experiments.
- **Research Value**: Extensively used in studies on social bot detection, behavior analysis, and network security.
